## Bio

I am a computer science student attending the fourth year of high school. 🎓🇮🇹 I'm Italian, and I have a strong passion for building things, especially abstract creations that, once constructed, seem almost magical. ✨🧙‍♂️ In addition to my love for coding and problem-solving, I possess strong communication and teamwork skills, making me an ideal candidate for companies looking for a versatile and creative individual to join their team. 🤝💼

I am also eager to learn and have a tremendous potential, ready to take on new challenges and expand my knowledge. 🚀💡
